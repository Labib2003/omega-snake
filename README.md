# omega-snake
This project is based on a Youtube tutorial by Web Dev Simplified (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTcIXok9wNY&t=764s) I followed the tutorial once and after that, made this version myself. 
This is my first large JS project using mustiple files.
Here are the things that I changed in this version,

1. Added an input field for the user to change the snake speed
2. Used arrow functions
3. Made it responive for mobiles and added touch buttons that only show up when viewed from mobile.
4. Added a new death screen instead of a DOM confirm.
